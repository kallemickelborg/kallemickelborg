> Building observability tooling for AI agents

🔗 **[mickelb.org](https://mickelb.org/)**

## What am I working on?
I'm currently working on [NodeTracer](https://github.com/kallemickelborg/nodetracer), a project I started because of my experience with missing or lacking observability frameworks for creating AI Agents.

I am also working on a [Stateful AI Agent](https://github.com/kallemickelborg/stateful-ai-agent), a human-in-the-loop stateful agentic system for information extraction from external PDF files from PubMed for medical research. This system ranks, summarizes and concludes based on the extracted research papers.
